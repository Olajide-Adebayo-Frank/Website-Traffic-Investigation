Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark on Kali Linux

This repository documents a hands-on exercise in network traffic analysis using Wireshark on Kali Linux. The goal is to capture, filter, and examine network packets specifically targeting a user's own website.

Prerequisites:

Kali Linux installed and running.
Wireshark (pre-installed on Kali).
Ability to access and browse your website from the Kali machine.
Root privileges for capturing network traffic.
Steps Covered:

Opening Wireshark and Exploring the Basic GUI: Learn how to launch Wireshark with root privileges and identify network interfaces.
Capturing Specific Website Traffic: Utilize capture filters to focus on traffic directed to and from your website's IP address.
Generating and Stopping Traffic Capture: Browse your website to generate traffic while Wireshark is capturing, then stop the capture.
Saving Captured Data: Learn how to save the captured network traffic to a .pcap file for later analysis.
(Upcoming/Future Step): Opening a detailed view of a single packet and exploring protocol layers.
This exercise is valuable for understanding network communication, basic packet analysis, and applying fundamental cybersecurity skills.
