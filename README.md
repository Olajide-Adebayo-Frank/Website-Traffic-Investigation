# Website-Traffic-Investigation
Just completed a hands-on cybersecurity task! Used Wireshark on Kali Linux to analyze network traffic for a specific website IP address. Filtered packets to identify key communication details, examined protocols, and analyzed data payloads. Saved the packet capture (.pcap) for in-depth reporting and future analysis.
